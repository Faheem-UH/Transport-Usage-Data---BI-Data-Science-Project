# Transport-Usage-Data---BI-Data-Science-Project
## Overview

This project focuses on analysing transport usage data to generate clear, reliable business information that supports operational insight and planning. The aim was to transform raw, complex data into accessible reporting outputs that highlight trends, patterns, and areas of interest for non-technical stakeholders.

The project reflects a business information and performance reporting approach, with emphasis on data quality, governance, and responsible interpretation of results.

## Objectives

- Clean and structure raw transport usage data to ensure accuracy and consistency

- Analyse trends, seasonality, and variation in usage over time

- Identify anomalies and unusual patterns that may require further investigation

- Present findings through clear visual outputs suitable for non-technical audiences

- Demonstrate how data can support operational monitoring and planning activities

## Data

The dataset consists of transport usage data provided in raw Excel format, covering multiple locations and time periods. The data was treated as operational data, with a strong focus on validation, consistency checks, and appropriate handling of missing or anomalous values.

Where necessary, assumptions and limitations were documented to ensure findings were interpreted responsibly.

## Tools and Technologies

- Excel – initial data review and structuring of raw files

- Python – data cleaning and analysis using pandas and NumPy, Clustering using K-means, and Forecasting using Prophet

- Visualisation – matplotlib and BI-style visuals to highlight trends and patterns

- Tableau – dashboard-style visual outputs to present insights clearly

## Approach

1) Reviewed and structured raw Excel files to understand data shape and content

2) Cleaned and transformed the data using Python to ensure accuracy and consistency

3) Performed validation checks and handled missing or anomalous values

4) Conducted exploratory analysis to identify trends, seasonality, and variations

5) Applied clustering techniques to group locations with similar usage patterns, supporting clearer segmentation and comparison of operational behaviour

6) Investigated unusual patterns to support accurate operational interpretation

7) Designed clear visual outputs and dashboards to communicate insights effectively

8) Focused on usability and clarity rather than technical complexity

## Key Outputs

1) Time-based trend analysis highlighting changes in transport usage

2) Visual summaries showing variation across locations and periods

3) Cluster-based segmentation of locations, highlighting groups with similar demand patterns to support targeted operational insight and planning

4) Identification of anomalous patterns requiring further investigation

5) Dashboard-style outputs designed for operational and planning discussions

## Key Learning Points

- The importance of data quality and validation before producing insights

- How visualisation choices impact stakeholder understanding

- The need to clearly communicate assumptions and limitations

- Translating technical analysis into meaningful business information

## Notes

This project was completed as an applied data analysis exercise and is intended to demonstrate analytical thinking, data handling, and reporting capability rather than act as a production system.
